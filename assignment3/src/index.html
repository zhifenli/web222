            <strong>Mount Tai</strong> rises 1,543 meters above sea level.
            <strong>Mount Tai</strong> is known as the eastern mountain of the Sacred Mountains of
            China. It is associated with sunrise, birth, and renewal, and is often regarded as the
            foremost of the five. <strong>Mount Tai</strong> has been a place of worship for at
            least 3,000 years and served as one of the most important ceremonial centers ofChina
            during large portions of this period.</q

          Its highest peak Yuhuangding stands over deep valleys and above other perilous peaks. A
          staircase leads you to the Heavenly Southern Gate, where you look around in the distance,
          enjoying with involuntary admiration the over-powering views of mountains beyond mountains
          and scenery beyond the scenery. You will be awed by the numerous grotesque rock
          formations, clear waterfalls, giant pine trees, temples, pavilions, bridges, pagodas, and
          stone inscriptions by poets, scholars, and calligraphers of various dynasties.

          Because of the various natural landscapes of <strong>Mount Tai</strong>, different seasons
          have their own unique charm. Whether it is <strong>Mount Tai</strong> covered by spring
          rains and mists, under the shining sun in summer, covered with golden leaves in autumn, or
          covered with snow in winter, all people will linger. The four seasons are different and
          the experience is also different. Each season here has its own beauty: bright flowers in
          full bloom covering the green slopes in spring; spectacular summer thunderstorms which are
          rarely seen elsewhere; blue rivers running across the mountains overlaid with red maple
          leaves in autumn; snow-capped mountains and frosted pine trees in winter that stage a
          quiet spectacle of the grandeur of particular interest. On a clear day, one can see peaks
          rising one after another. When the sky is overcast, the horizon disappears into a sea of
          clouds. The mountain is also known for its spectacular sunrise and sunset, the beauty of
          which is unparalleled elsewhere.

          In addition to its natural heritage, <strong>Mount Tai</strong> is also a cultural
          heritage. We can see here <strong>Mount Tai</strong> is the land of <i>Qilu</i> and even
          one of the origins of Chinese civilization. We can see traces of time flowing on it,
          accompanied by the mysterious atmosphere of religion. Dai Temple is the representative. It
          is the place where the emperors of the past dynasties held the Zen ceremony and worshipped
          the god of <strong>Mount Tai</strong>.
          <q cite="https://www.chinahighlights.com/mount-tai/"
            >According to historical records, Mount Tai became a sacred place visited by emperors to
            offer sacrifices and meditate in the Zhou Dynasty before 1000 BC. A total of 72 emperors
            were recorded as visiting it.</q
          >
          Writers also came to acquire inspiration, compose poems, write essays, paint and take
          pictures. Hence, a great many cultural relics were left on the mountain. The Great Deity
          of <strong>Mount Tai</strong> is the supreme god of <strong>Mount Tai</strong>. According
          to one mythological tradition, he is a descendant of Pangu. According to other theologies,
          he is the eastern one of the Five Manifestations of the Highest Deity .<em
            >Bixia Yuanjun</em
          >, literally the "Goddess of the Blue Dawn", is also known as the "Heavenly Immortal Lady
          of Jade" or the "Lady of <strong>Mount Tai</strong>". According to some mythological
          accounts, she is the daughter or the consort of the Great Deity of
          <strong>Mount Tai</strong>. The statues of <em>Bixia Yuanjun</em> often depict her holding
          a tablet with the Big Dipper as a symbol of her authority. Yanguang Niangniang is
          venerated as the goddess of eyesight and is often portrayed as an attendant to Bixia
          Yuanjun. <em>Songzi Niangniang</em> is seen as a goddess of the fertility, like
          <em>Yanguang Nainai</em>, she is often portrayed as an attendant to Bixia Yuanjun.
          <em>Shigandang</em> is a spirit sent down from <strong>Mount Tai</strong> by Bixia Yuanjun
          to protect ordinary people from evil spirits. As part of cultural tradition, there will
          also often be Taishan <em>Shigandang</em> stones set up near buildings and other places,
          in order to protect those places from evil spirits. These are not to be confused with
          spirit tablets.
