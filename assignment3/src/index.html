        Located in central Shandong Province, just north of the city of Tai'an and to the south of
        the provincial capital Jinan. Mount Tai rises 1,543 meters above sea level. Mount Tai is
        known as the eastern mountain of the Sacred Mountains of China. It is associated with
        sunrise, birth, and renewal, and is often regarded as the foremost of the five. Mount Tai
        has been a place of worship for at least 3,000 years and served as one of the most important
        ceremonial centers ofChina during large portions of this period. Its highest peak
        Yuhuangding stands over deep valleys and above other perilous peaks. A staircase leads you
        to the Heavenly Southern Gate, where you look around in the distance, enjoying with
        involuntary admiration the over-powering views of mountains beyond mountains and scenery
        beyond the scenery. You will be awed by the numerous grotesque rock formations, clear
        waterfalls, giant pine trees, temples, pavilions, bridges, pagodas, and stone inscriptions
        by poets, scholars, and calligraphers of various dynasties.

        Because of the various natural landscapes of Mount Tai, different seasons have their own
        unique charm. Whether it is Mount Tai covered by spring rains and mists, under the shining
        sun in summer, covered with golden leaves in autumn, or covered with snow in winter, all
        people will linger. The four seasons are different and the experience is also different.
        Each season here has its own beauty: bright flowers in full bloom covering the green slopes
        in spring; spectacular summer thunderstorms which are rarely seen elsewhere; blue rivers
        running across the mountains overlaid with red maple leaves in autumn; snow-capped mountains
        and frosted pine trees in winter that stage a quiet spectacle of the grandeur of particular
        interest. On a clear day, one can see peaks rising one after another. When the sky is
        overcast, the horizon disappears into a sea of clouds. The mountain is also known for its
        spectacular sunrise and sunset, the beauty of which is unparalleled elsewhere.

        In addition to its natural heritage, Mount Tai is also a cultural heritage. We can see here
        Mount Tai is the land of Qilu and even one of the origins of Chinese civilization. We can
        see traces of time flowing on it, accompanied by the mysterious atmosphere of religion. Dai
        Temple is the representative. It is the place where the emperors of the past dynasties held
        the Zen ceremony and worshipped the god of Mount Tai. According to historical records, Mount
        Tai became a sacred place visited by emperors to offer sacrifices and meditate in the Zhou
        Dynasty before 1000 BC. A total of 72 emperors were recorded as visiting it. Writers also
        came to acquire inspiration, compose poems, write essays, paint and take pictures. Hence, a
        great many cultural relics were left on the mountain. The Great Deity of Mount Tai is the
        supreme god of Mount Tai. According to one mythological tradition, he is a descendant of
        Pangu. According to other theologies, he is the eastern one of the Five Manifestations of
        the Highest Deity . Bixia Yuanjun, literally the "Goddess of the Blue Dawn", is also known
        as the "Heavenly Immortal Lady of Jade" or the "Lady of Mount Tai". According to some
        mythological accounts, she is the daughter or the consort of the Great Deity of Mount Tai.
        The statues of Bixia Yuanjun often depict her holding a tablet with the Big Dipper as a
        symbol of her authority. Yanguang Niangniang is venerated as the goddess of eyesight and is
        often portrayed as an attendant to Bixia Yuanjun. Songzi Niangniang is seen as a goddess of
        the fertility, like Yanguang Nainai, she is often portrayed as an attendant to Bixia
        Yuanjun. Shi Gandang is a spirit sent down from Mount Tai by Bixia Yuanjun to protect
        ordinary people from evil spirits. As part of cultural tradition, there will also often be
        Taishan Shi Gandang stones set up near buildings and other places, in order to protect those
        places from evil spirits. These are not to be confused with spirit tablets.
